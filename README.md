# UART-DV
## GOAL: Using SystemVerilog to build a UART Interface module and verify it.
### Introduction

A universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter ( UART ) is a peripheral device for asynchronous serial communication in which the data format and transmission speeds are configurable. It sends data bits one by one, from the least significant to the most significant, framed by start and stop bits so that precise timing is handled by the communication channel. The electric signaling levels are handled by a driver circuit external to the UART.

The advantage is that the line is simple, with only two lines, but the disadvantage is that it can only be connected one to one, and the speed is not very fast.
